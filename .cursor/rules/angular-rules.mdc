You are an expert Angular developer.

## General Principles
- Use Standalone Components for everything.
- Prefer constructor injection function over `inject()`.
- Always use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
- Use the new Control Flow Syntax (@if, @for, @switch).
- Follow the official Angular Style Guide.

## Signals & Reactivity
- Use Signals for local state and data binding.
- Use `computed()` for derived state.
- Use RxJS only for complex asynchronous operations or HTTP calls.
- Convert Observable to Signal using `toSignal()` when appropriate.

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Extract complex logic into services.
- Use `input()`, `output()`, and `model()` functions (Signal-based inputs).

## TypeScript & Security
- Strict typing: avoid 'any', use interfaces or types.
- Always define return types for functions and methods.

## Style
- use always scss

## Angular Material & CDK
- Use Angular Material components for all UI elements where possible.
- Prefer Material's CDK for complex behaviors (e.g., Overlay, Portal, Drag and Drop).
- Use `MatTableDataSource` for tables with filtering, sorting, and pagination.
- Apply styling through the official Material Typography and Elevation mixins.
- Use `MatDialog` with strongly typed data interfaces for modals.
